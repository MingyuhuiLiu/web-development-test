    <h1>Character Entity</h1>
    <p>
        &quot; Dont be afraid to be &lt a 100% &amp &gt more.
        There's another HTML entity reference that is very commonly used and unfortunately, 
        a lot of time misused as well. 
        Let's say for example that in the last sentence here that ends timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. 
        Let's say we wanted the words victory nor defeat never to wrap, 
        but always stay the same. 
        So, what do I mean by that? 
        Let me pull the browser and make it a little bit less wide. 
        And as you can see, the word victory nor defeat is split up into different lines. 
        Let's say I didn't want that. 
        For whatever visual reason I wanted the words victory nor defeat to always stay the same. 
        So if it is going to wrap, it should either not wrap at all or wrap all together. 
        Well, the way you do that is with a non-breaking space. 
        And the way you use it is nbsp;. 
        Not breaking space, or removing all spaces&nbsp; between&nbsp; the words. &quot;
